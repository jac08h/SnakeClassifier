[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jac08h/SnakeClassifier/master?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2Fsnake_classifier.ipynb)

A neural network model that decides between Coral Snake and Kingsnake.

#### Approach
* I was following the [fastai course](https://course.fast.ai/) - [Chapter 2](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/02_production.ipynb).
* The model was trained using ~100 images of each snake species. Variations of the images were created using data augmentation.
* Accuracy of the model is about 90%.

You can run the model by clicking the above *launch|binder* button.
